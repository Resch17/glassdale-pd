## A Nashville Software School JS/CSS/HTML
This project is intended to reinforce the fundamentals of modularizing a web application, utilizing external and custom APIs, fetch API, event-driven decoupled module communication, and DOM manipulation.

By the end of the project, I have gained a strong understanding of the above principles, as well as diving into database structure and relationships.
